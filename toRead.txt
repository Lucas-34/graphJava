Hello,

We couldn't compile the files due to a package error.
Repl.it and IntelliJ didn't want to let us compile.
We tried with packages and imports but nothing worked.

So we couldn't create the executable .jar file with the following command:
`jar -cvfm graphImpl.jar src/graph/Manifest.txt bin/graph/*.class``

Thank you for your understanding, 
Have a good day,
Lo√Øs & Lucas.
